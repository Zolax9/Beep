# Beep

Play MIDIs with the PC speaker.

Licensed under GPLv2 (for license compatibility with _beep_)

# Functionality

* Read MIDI-converted CSVs and convert the notes to PC speaker frequencies
* Emulates playing overlapping notes by playing them closely together

# To-do

* Rewrite in C (maybe?)
* Clean up code
* Create a TUI interface to account for different configs for CSVs (Note\_off\_c support, maximum velocities of 100, 128, etc.)
* Use extra functionality in _beep_ to play multiple notes

# Requirements

* None

# Thanks
